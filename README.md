# Ocean Modeling Exercises in Julia

This repository contains Julia code that recreates ocean modeling exercises from the books by Jochen KÃ¤mpf: "Ocean modelling for beginners: using open-source software" (2009) and "Advanced ocean modelling: using open-source software" (2010), published by Springer Science & Business Media.

The code provided here is intended to serve as a learning exercise for understanding ocean modeling concepts using the Julia programming language. 

Please note that this repository is not officially associated with the author or publisher of the aforementioned books. The code is provided "as is" and is developed solely for educational purposes. While efforts have been made to accurately recreate the exercises, there may be variations from the original implementations.
